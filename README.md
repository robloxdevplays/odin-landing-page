# odin-landing-page

This is the second project in the Odin Project curriculam, and the first one I am doing under it. I skipped the restaurant page for now so, it's my first. I designed the page using CSS and HTML without any frameworks, and used a bit more flexbox than I normally use. I learned a lot of new stuff, and it's very cool completing a project like this.
